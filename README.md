# SlotMachine

This is a generic slot machine game. 
The player will have to insert an amount of cash which will be stored in his account. From here the choice to bet on one, two or three lines.
The slot machine will check for a winning combination on the selected lines, both horizontally and vertically, and the player will get $1 back for each winning combination.
(e.g. if player bets $3 dollars for three line and the slotmachine outputs only one winning combination then the player will win only $1).
